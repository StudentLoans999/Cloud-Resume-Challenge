My journey to complete Step 7 (using Javascript to create a Visitor Counter for my resume webpage).

Below I listed the actions I took

## Table of Contents
- [Action 1](#Action-1)
- [Action 2](#Action-2)
- [Action 3](#Action-3)
- [Final product](#Final-product)

***
## Action 1 
Followed this website and updated my index.html and style.css file to include the new information: https://contactmentor.com/build-website-visitor-counter-javascript/
***
## Action 2
I uploaded the new index.html and style.css into my S3 bucket, along with the newly created script.js
***
## Action 3
The domain wouldn't update with the new html so I went into the CloudFront distribution and did a wildcard Invalidation /* which solved the issus.
