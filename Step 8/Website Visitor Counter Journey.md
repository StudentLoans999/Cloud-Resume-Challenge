My journey to complete Step 7 (using Javascript to create a Visitor Counter for my resume webapge).

Below I listed the actions I took

***
## Step 1 
Followed this website and updated my index.html and style.css file to include the new information: https://contactmentor.com/build-website-visitor-counter-javascript/
***
## Step 2
I uploaded the new index.html and style.css into my S3 bucket, along with the newly created script.js
***
## Step 3
The domain wouldn't update with the new html so I went into the CloudFront distribution and did a wildcard Invalidation /* which solved the issus.
# Final product:
https://davidrichey.org/ aka davidrichey.org and also www.davidrichey.org
