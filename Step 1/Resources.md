   c. step 4.3 ; After creating user and Access Keys - used this video to install AWS CLI and set credentials as environment variables so not storing credentials and config files locally (which is bad security practice) ; I then deleted the config and credentials files : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWAnY-w1SGQ

  c. 4.4 ; Tried to run the command to create a CodeCommit repository and a CodePipeline but it failed due to it not finding the credentials file (which I deleted in the last step since thought wasn't needed since stored as a environment variable) : ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77641113/235282568-d4390b66-e794-401a-9f7f-ae9bad848122.png)
