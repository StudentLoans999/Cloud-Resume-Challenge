Following the CRC Guidebook, the first step is to set up an AWS personal development environment, and there are two ways of doing that (original, professional).
I chose the more difficult yet recommended option - the professional way - which is to use org-formation (open source tool to setup an AWS Organization, Organizational Units (OU), etc. through infrastructure-as-code).

Step 1 is setting up and implementing org-formation to create an active OU (for active accounts) and a dev OU (active accounts with less permissions), and a suspended OU for suspended accounts
