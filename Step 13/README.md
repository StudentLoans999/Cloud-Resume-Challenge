Created a new GitHub branch in my AWS repo called Cloud-Resume-Challenge

All the steps below are given by GitHub (except for configuring your identity)

Then in CMD, I change directory (cd) into C:\IT\AWS\CRC\CRC GitHub Source Control repo then ran "git init" to initialize the repo

Then did "git add ." which adds all the local stuff to the repo

Then did "git commit -m "Initial commit"" but got this error message about identity being unknown, so I ran "git config user.email "davidsacc@gmail.com"

Then did "git branch -M main" to add a branch (main) to the repo

Then ran "git remote add origin https://github.com/StudentLoans999/Cloud-Resume-Challenge.git" to add the repo to the remote site 

Then did "git push -u origin main"

Refreshed the page and saw the main branch was added with the files (for me it is a folder named website and inside of that are my .html .css and .js files)
