My journey to complete Step 2-7 (creating and hosting a static website) begins with following this guide : https://bahr.dev/2022/02/07/org-formation/ (also in Resources.md *c)
  (I will refer to it as OG guide going forward)

Below I listed the actions I took
***
Step 1 ; Registered a domain (davidrichey.org) using Route53 in AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html)
***

Step 2 ; Created a bucket in AWS called resume.davidrichey.org  (needed to put the domain in the name so that DNS can route to the bucket in a later step) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)

Step 3 ; Created a bucket in AWS called resume.davidrichey.org  (needed to put the domain in the name so that DNS can route to the bucket in a later step) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)
